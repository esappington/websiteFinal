  <h1>Eric Sappington</h1>
  <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hello, I was born in 1989 in Missouri. I have one child currently named
    Rayden who usually takes up the majority of my time. He lives with me in
    my home in Columbia along with our cat named Cat Stevens <i>AKA</i> Kitty
    Stevens. The rest of my time i enjoy gaming occasionally, gardening, biking,
    fishing, and anything that involves a motor. My favorite team is the St.
    Louis Blues and i try to get to the games when i can.

  <h2>Life Plan</h2>
  <p>I have been trying to conquer my finances to help become the most independent person that i can as soon as possible. Going back to school is a step in that right direction, but must be done in the correct way. Student loans can tie a person down
    for their whole life, and my loans are just under $15k which is managable. Besides trying to increase income, finances need to be maintained at home as well. No financing anything except for my morgtage and slowly erase any payments i have
    incurred over the years </p>
  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <ol>
    <b>
      <li>Pay off debt from lowest to highest</li>
      <li>Concentrate on learning as many new skills as possible</li>
      <li>Practice computer learning minimum 2 hours a day</li>
      <li>Create a monthly budger and religously stick to it.</li>
      <li>concentrate on always evolving and keeping an open mind!</li>
